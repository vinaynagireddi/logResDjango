Project Description : 
This project was built to implement a full user authentication flow using Django and MongoDB with a custom frontend. The goal was to understand session handling, user data validation, and AJAX-based form submissions. It also demonstrates how Django can be used with a non-relational database like MongoDB.

 Developer Notes :
     I developed both frontend and backend from scratch.

     Implemented login/register logic using Django views and MongoDB via mongoengine.

     Used jQuery and AJAX to handle dynamic form interactions without page reloads.

     Ensured secure session handling and redirect flow after authentication.
     
 Key Highlights : 
    Custom form validation with real-time error handling via AJAX.

    Seamless redirect to data visibility dashboard after login.

    Clean UI with responsive design using CSS and jQuery.

Future Enhancements :
    Add password reset functionality via email.

    Integrate user roles (e.g., admin/user).

    Add charts or visualizations on the dashboard using Chart.js or D3.js.

    Dockerize the app for easier deployment.

Acknowledgements :
    Special thanks to open-source communities and documentation for Django, MongoEngine, and jQuery.
